# Workshop 2
Introduction to Machine Learning Workshop
Conducted on: 28-08-2019

## Agenda
- Slides explaining the field of machine learning in brief, gradient descent with derivation and working of AI team in the club.
- Hands-on session on Linear Regression

## Resources
Resources used in Machine Learning workshop:
1) Slides- http://bit.ly/cl-ml-2019-slides
2) Interactive Notebook: https://bit.ly/cl-ml-2019
3) Solutions to the Notebook: http://bit.ly/cl-ml-2019-solutions

Further Resources:
1) Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng, Stanford University: http://bit.ly/ml-andrew-ng
2) More resources in our very own "Get Started" repository: http://bit.ly/cl-get-started

## Summary
First half was utilized for the slides, with attendees getting introduced to machine learning, understanding mathematics and intuition behind gradient descent etc. The workings of the club were also discussed.

In the second half, attendees had to code their way through a machine learning exercise where they trained a simple linear regression model to fit a synthetically generated data. At the end, there was also a mini-competition, wherein the attendees competed against each other to get minimum loss on a real life dataset (the winner was awarded with a chocolate bar).

## Agenda for the next session
Discussion on assigned projects
