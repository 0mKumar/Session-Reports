## Summary
The projects were discussed at length and groups were created based on the preference of the club members.

The final groups with their assigned projects:

| Sr. No. | Project Title                                                | Team Members (GitHub Usernames)         | Github Repository |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1.      | A full scale ML library which uses HSIC instead of backpropagation: It has significant leverage in terms of gradient flow, speed, and is at par or above in terms of accuracy with back propagation. The paper was released just recently. | rath772k, yb221, Samuelimza                         | TBA               |
| 2.      | Activation function search for robustness to initialisation: Try out different combinations of activations functions and find out the one giving the best results. | Arnav0400, sgsonu, ubamba98             | TBA               |
| 3.      | Adversarial Attacks: Design a generative network that transforms an image to something that fools the given detection model to incorrectly classify it. | ss407102, ayu-22,                       | TBA               |
| 4.      | Social cause - Segmentation of garbage on the road: Design a model that will detect and segment out the garbage on roads. The solution will be deployed using an autonomous bot and will alert the garbage collection system. | sabirali2560, chefpr7, asciarp08        | TBA               |
| 5.      | Single image super resolution: Given a single image, try to increase its resolution manifolds without noticeable loss in quality. | Anshumanc007, naineshhulke              | TBA               |
| 6       | Style transfer on videos: Instead of applying style transfer frame by frame, apply it on a set of frames at once, using RNNs. | devvats, LusiferAjay, PrinceArya        | TBA               |
| 7.      | Pose Guided Person Image Generation : Synthesize person images in arbitrary poses, based on an image of that person and a novel pose. Useful in  shopping websites in generating different poses of the same person wearing the same outfit. Paper link : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09368 | TheLethargicOwl, anikett12, mihitkeshav | TBA               |
| 8.      | Biomedical Image Captioning: Generate captions for medical images. This is a research topic with not much work done before. | IAmSuyogJadhav, AryanRaj315, rishabh-16 | TBA               |
| 9.      | Automatic summarisation of a text document: Given a text document, generate a short summary of its content. | shivansh55, Aliasgarsaifee, vanshikaarora              | TBA               |
